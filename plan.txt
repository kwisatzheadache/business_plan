      MEASURE PREDICT PREVENT
    ii. Maps movement to established medical literature regarding gait disorders and falling. Specifically modelled on FallProof by Dr Rose. Extracts activities and metrics about stand-sit, turning, walking, balance, symmetry, strength and power. Mobility time-series data to diagnosis to intervention.
    iii. Unique feature: RISK PREVENTION, activity extraction
      a. COMPARISON TO CURRENT MARKET... spire, fitbit. what are there limitations? Is there a european version of libra in development?
      b. nothing in US does what embrace does. Yet.
    iv. DRAWBACKS:
      a. 3 to 6 months for many of the predictive metrics. Q: Are there any informative metrics right off the back? Perhaps symmetry? Power in sit-stand/stand-sit? For CCRC, not a problem as much.
      b. Mistaken for fitbit
      c. Limited market (CCRC's and old folks)
      d. Possible to do all of this with a phone?
    v. HEADSTARTS
      a. First on the market
      b. Patenting nx10 device with activity extraction
      c. CCRC commitments
      d. Dr Rose expertise
      e. Connections in the community
    vi. Expansion past Libra
      a. Prediction of other illnesses
      b. Use as an activity tracker
  C. MARKET ENTRY
